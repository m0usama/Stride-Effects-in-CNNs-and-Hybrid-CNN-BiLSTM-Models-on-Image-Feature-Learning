# Stride-Effects-in-CNNs-and-Hybrid-CNN-BiLSTM-Models-on-Image-Feature-Learning
This project explores how convolution stride affects feature extraction in CNNs and how these changes influence a hybrid CNN–BiLSTM model. Results show stride 1 captures detail but overfits, stride 2 generalises better, and the hybrid model adds complexity without improving accuracy.
